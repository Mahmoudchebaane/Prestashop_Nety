Hi All,

Greetings of the day.

The module helps to add image on all website pages a preloader, also known, as a loading page, or preloading screen it’s the loading animation or static image that shows on the website while the page is loading in the background.
 
Implement a preloader to make the product or app look more professional, reinforce the branding and product positioning, make the waiting time pass more quickly, and ultimately stop users from leaving the page before it’s ready to use.

A good preloader should be visually pleasing and show progress visually through simple animations or good images.

A preloader can be seen while waiting for a website or application to load

Preloaders are important interface elements that let visitors know that the website hasn't crashed, it's just processing data

Preloaders not only look fantastic, but they also play a critical part in the functionality of your website. While lengthy loading times are inconvenient, they do not have to be a deal-breaker. By deploying preloaders where required, you may reduce the loss of revenue caused by poor connections
